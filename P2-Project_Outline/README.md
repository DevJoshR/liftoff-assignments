### What I'll Have to Learn
   My biggest obstacle on creating this app will be figuring out the dynamics involved with getting all of the 
information on a pie-graph visual. Doing so will require some research.
   I will also need to get a better understanding of the work flow of a Spring Boot application. As well
as connecting all of the clients information to a database. 
   Lastly, will need information on incorporating JavaScript to add click events to the pie-graph.
