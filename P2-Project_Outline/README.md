## Submission Instructions

### Overview

    Our app will allow clients to see a visual representation of their financial information  which will included both 
income and expenses. 
    I thought of this idea because I know that budgeting can be an overwhelming task. This is the case for many 
indivisuals. Especially for a person who has too many finances to mentally keep track of. So this is where our app comes
in. 


### Features

 Client register/ login: clients will be able to create and manage their own indivisual accounts. All accounts 
will be secured by one-way encryption. Upon login, indivisuals will be able to have access to their own profiles. 

 Financial chart: clients will be able to see all of their entered finances in the form of a pie-table visual. Any 
financial information entered will be in its own category.

 Update finances: clients will be able to alter any of the information they have entered. Which includes, 
adding, updating, or deleting any table information pictured

 Recommendations: clients wil be provided with text-based feedback based on the information displayed on the pie-graph

### What I'll Have to Learn


      My biggest obstacle on creating this app will be figuring out the dynamics involved with getting all the 
information on a pie-graph visial. Doing so will require some research.
      I will also need to get a better understanding of the work flow of a Spring Boot application. As well
as connecting all of the clients information to a database. 
      Lastly, incorporating JavaScript to add click events to pie-graph
